## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've discovered a security vulnerability, I appreciate your help in disclosing it to me 
in a [responsible manner][link-responsible-disclosure] by sending me an [email](mailto:smhex@mailbox.org?subject=%5BSECURITY%5D).
I will work with you to make sure I understand the scope of the issue, and that I fully address your concern.

After a security vulnerability has been corrected, a security hotfix release will be deployed as soon as possible.
